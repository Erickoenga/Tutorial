<h2>dogs seem to come in all sizes</h2>
<p>One day a farmer bought a black puppy from his friend who lived in a lonely home far away in the mountains of Nziki.<br> The farmer woke up in the morning and took his motor bike, rode all the way to Nziki village to meet his old friend. They all had fun and enjoyed exchanging memories when they were young. They shared a meal and had a good time altogether. While they were walking around the old man's yard, the farmer saw some tiny puppys playing with a ball.</p>

<p>The Old man was impressed with the smile of the farmer while he was looking at the small dog. Having liked them he got a chance to buy one of them and take it to his yard too.<br>Reaching home, his two boys were happy about the puppy!! The older son liked the way he 'danced the tail'and the younger son liked the various smiles a dog can put on the face. The younger son was given a responsibility of feeding the dog because he liked the face part of the puppy, and the older one was given a task to clean the dogs feces after eating now that he liked the way the puppy moved his tail around.<br>Later on the puppy grew to be a great and healthy dog in the village. Unbeliavable.</p>
